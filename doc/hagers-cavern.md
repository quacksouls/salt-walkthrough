# Hager's Cavern

This is an optional area. However, defeating the area boss would unlock the path
to obtaining the Redshift Brand. You require the brand to access other mandatory
areas in the game. At Hager's Cavern, you would also be able to advance the
quest lines of the Despondent Thief and the Masterless Knight.

In this area, you will encounter a merchant named Minty Skell who sells various
upgrade materials. You must give Minty a Red Lord's Ear before she opens her
shop. Return to Red Hall of Cages and farm the Red Lords in case you do not yet
have a Red Lord's Ear. Use the farmed salt to level up and invest in skills that
boost your Endurance. Before exploring Hager's Cavern, equip armour pieces that
provide better defense than the Rogue set. At the very least equip the Split
Mask, Chain Gauntlets, and Chain Chausses. Equip the Fused Metal Ring to
increase your Endurance by 3 points. No matter which armour pieces you equip,
ensure your equip load is less than 70%.

Start from the sanctuary of Hager's Cavern. Head right to collect some
treasures, then proceed left and up to find an Armor Mite guarded by Emberskull
x 2. Below the platform where the Armor Mite stands can be found the Masterless
Knight. Normally you cannot reach the Masterless Knight unless you have a brand
from a later area of the game. However, the Masterless Knight can be reached by
rolling off the edge of the said platform. Interact with the knight and exhaust
his dialogue to progress in his quest line. Continue exploring the upper half of
Hager's Cavern to find the Despondent Thief. Answer "Yes" to her question and
exhaust her dialogue. Continue on up to find a lever that unlocks a shortcut to
Sunken Keep.

When you are done exploring the upper half of Hager's Cavern, explore the lower
half to unlock the grated gate to the area boss. You must interact with an
obelisk to allow you to find the lever that opens the grated gate, and you must
find the Cellar Key that unlocks the path to the above gate. The key also
unlocks the passage to Minty Skell. Interact with Minty, answer "Harvester" to
her question, and give her a Red Lord's Ear to open her shop. Purchase Locks of
Hair and A Soldier's Poems from Minty as necessary to upgrade your armour pieces
and/or weapons.

Consider farming the Primitive Bones and Pale Witch for Drowned Locket. You need
Drowned Locket x 3 to upgrade the Obsidian Pillar II to Obsidian Pillar IV. Note
that the Obsidian Pillar III is more than enough for Hager's Cavern and the
upcoming area, i.e. Mire of Stench.

Notable loots:

-   Trickster's Band. Equip to increase your Dexterity. Useful for a Dexterity
    build.
-   Stone Cleric x 2. One is from the same shiny where you collect the
    Trickster's Band. The other is guarded by Vacant Blades x 2.
-   Sack of Salt x 2
-   Flame Guardian. An Incantation that inflicts fire damage. On a platform to
    the left of where the Despondent Thief sits.
-   Saper Charm. Equip on your weapon to restore a small amount of focus with
    each successful hit. Useful for a Mage build.
-   Drowned Idol x 3
-   Whistlebone Charm. Reduce the amount of Stamina required for melee attacks.
    Might be useful for a Strength build. However, the Bloodflower Charm is a
    better choice for a Strength build and you should invest in skills that
    increase your Stamina.
-   Divine Blessed Weapon. A Prayer that buffs your weapon with holy damage. Use
    Blessed Page instead if you cannot afford to invest in Prayer skills. Found
    on a platform guarded by Angsty Bones x 2.
-   Stone Mage x 2. One is located on a platform to the left of where you
    collect the Divine Blessed Weapon. Must navigate various
    disappearing/appearing platforms to reach the item.
-   Charred Doll x 3
-   Goldenstone Charm. Adds lightning damage to your melee attacks. A viable
    alternative is to buff your weapon with (Imperial) Shockstone.
-   Ring of Brilliance. Illuminates your surrounding. Equip this together with
    the Lantern Charm to provide the same degree of brightness as the Torch,
    while allowing you to two-hand your weapon.
-   Stone Guide. Guarded by Split Swordsman x 3.
-   Cellar Key. In a cave below where you find Split Swordsman x 3, guarded by a
    Heartseeker and numerous Dropspiders. The key allows you to open two doors:
    one leading to Minty Skell and the other to the area boss.
-   Amber Idol. An ingredient for transmutation. Found in the same cave as where
    you collect the Stone Guide.
-   Warhorn. A consumable that boosts the rate of your Stamina regeneration.
    Found behind the door that is unlocked by the Cellar Key. Can be purchased
    from the Cleric NPC, provided that you join the creed The Iron Ones.
-   Symbol of Affluence. Boosts the amount of gold you receive from each
    defeated enemy. Locked behind the door that is opened via the Cellar Key.
-   Gray Pearl. You need the Cellar Key to collect this item.
-   Silver Leaf x 3. Behind a door unlocked by the Spiked Key.

{% youtube id="D1axjFwYtOg", title="25. Farm for A Lord's Orders at Hager's Caverns, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

Hager's Cavern has a cave where you can find Split Swordsman x 3. Farm the Split
Swordsman for A Lord's Orders to upgrade your armour pieces and/or weapons. The
Split Swordsmans also drop A Soldier's Poem. Equip the Kismet Stone and the
Brightcoral Ring to boost your item find rate. Have plenty of Bells of Return
for quick travel to the sanctuary where you last rested.

Before fighting the area boss, talk to the Leader NPC and turn in various items
for a reward. For now, you want the Imperial Pitchfire so you do not have to
purchase Pitchfire from the Merchant NPC. Farm the relevant enemies as necessary
for the required items(s). Visit a Blacksmith to upgrade the following armour
pieces as high as possible: Split Mask, Rogue's Jacket, Chain Gauntlets, Chain
Chausses. Do not use A Lord's Orders to upgrade the Rogue's Jacket, but instead
spend the material on the Split Mask or any of the pieces in the Chain set.

## Disemboweled Husk

{% youtube id="yeT_OA2tNpI", title="26. The Disemboweled Husk, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

The boss deals fire damage. Equip the Impen Crest Ring to boost your fire
defense. Buff the Obsidian Pillar III with Blessed Page.

Defeat the boss to receive the Spiked Key. Use the key to unlock the door
leading to the Mire of Stench. Enter the Mire of Stench and rest at its
sanctuary as soon as possible.
