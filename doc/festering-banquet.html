<p>Head right and open a door to enter an area called The Festering Banquet.
Enemies here drop various useful consumables and upgrade materials. You might
want to farm the enemies for salt, gold, as well as the items they drop. The
area has a number of useful items described below. Collect as many of these as
you can. The most important item is the Stone Blacksmith as it can be used to
spawn the Blacksmith NPC. You need this NPC to upgrade your weapons and armour
pieces. Near the boss arena is a shrine. Rest at the shrine to restore your HP
and Red Flask and make any last minute preparation prior to fighting the area
boss. Farm enough salt with a view to obtaining the skill Class 1 Heavy
Macefighter as well as the skill Class 2 Heavy Macefighter. These skills are
required to use the Warhammer, the main weapon we will use in many upcoming
areas of the game.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfwL93qUDk" target="_blank">2. Farm salt &amp; gold at Shivering Shore, Salt and Sanctuary</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BfwL93qUDk" title="2. Farm salt &amp; gold at Shivering Shore, Salt and Sanctuary" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/8BfwL93qUDk/0.jpg" alt="2. Farm salt &amp; gold at Shivering Shore, Salt and Sanctuary"></a></p>
<p>Notable loots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Shard x 9. Can also be farmed from Rotten Walkers, Rotten Crossbowman,
and Skullbat.</li>
<li>Torch x 3. Also dropped by Rotten Walker and Rotten Crossbowman. Many areas
in the game are dark and some are pitch-black. Having plenty of Torches
ready would greatly help to illuminate your surrounding as you navigate your
way around an area. Torches can be purchased from various merchants.</li>
<li>Lock of Hair. Dropped by Rotten Crossbowman. You need Lock of Hair x 3 to
upgrade the Varangian Spatha, which is your starting weapon as a Knight, to
Varangian Spatha II. Do not worry if you cannot get the Rotten Crossbowman
to drop Locks of Hair. You would be able to purchase the upgrade material
later on, after defeating the area boss.</li>
<li>Rotten Walker&apos;s Ear. Dropped by Rotten Walker. Exchange Rotten Walker&apos;s Ears
with a Leader in return for a reward of your choosing. In later areas of the
game, you will collect an item called the Stone Leader. Offering the item at
a sanctuary would spawn an NPC called a Leader. The presence of a Leader in
the sanctuary of an area would boost your salt gain by 10%, provided you
defeat enemies found in that area. Offer various items to a Leader in order
to increase your Creed Devotion and obtain a number of rewards in return.</li>
<li>Skullbat Wing. Dropped by Skullbat. Exchange Skullbat Wings with a Leader to
deepen your Creed Devotion and choose a reward.</li>
<li>Pouch of Salt. Found on a corpse near a grated gate.</li>
<li>Bundle of Salt. The same location as where you collect the Stone Merchant.</li>
<li>Stone Merchant. Found near a shortcut. Kick down the ladder to unlock the
shortcut. Offer at a sanctuary to spawn the Merchant NPC from whom you can
purchase various consumable items, among other items. Strictly speaking, you
need to spawn the Merchant NPC at only one sanctuary. You can then use the
services of the Guide NPC to travel to the particular sanctuary and purchase
items from the Merchant. If you are to spawn only one Merchant NPC, you
might as well do so at the sanctuary of Shivering Shore.</li>
<li>Bell of Return. A consumable item that returns you to the last sanctuary or
shrine at which you rested.</li>
<li>Stone Cleric. Offer at a sanctuary to spawn the Cleric NPC from whom you can
purchase Prayers and other items. For a Strength build, the most useful
consumable sold by the Cleric NPC is the Blessed Page. Buff your melee
weapon with a Blessed Page to add holy damage to your attacks. Stock up on
Blessed Page because many bosses in the game are vulnerable against holy
damage. If you want to spawn the Cleric NPC, you might want to do so at
least at the sanctuary of Shivering Shore or at the sanctuary of The Village
of Smiles.</li>
<li>Rogue&apos;s set. A lightweight armour set that offers decent protection and
allows you to equip a heavy weapon without being overburdened.</li>
<li>Bandaged Ring. As you take more and more damage from enemies, your HP bar
would decrease due to wounding. The Bandaged Ring reduces the effect of
wounding so your HP bar would not decrease as much as compared to when you
do not equip the ring.</li>
<li>Mend. A Prayer that restores HP and reduces wound. Can also be purchased
from a Cleric. The Prayer is found next to a lever that unlocks a shortcut.</li>
<li>Stone Blacksmith. Offer at a sanctuary to spawn the Blacksmith NPC who can
upgrade your weapons and armour pieces. You do not need to spawn the
Blacksmith NPC because one will be found at the sanctuary of The Village of
Smiles. Use the services of the Guide NPC to travel to the particular
sanctuary and avail yourself of the services of the Blacksmith.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-sodden-knight">The Sodden Knight</h2>

The Sodden Knight, Salt and Sanctuary" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/knr1tGqyqlw/0.jpg" alt="3. The Sodden Knight, Salt and Sanctuary"></a></p>
<p>Offer the Stone Merchant at the sanctuary to spawn the Merchant NPC. Purchase
approximately Birian Firepot x 15 from the Merchant; you might need to farm for
gold to purchase up to Birian Firepot x 10. The fight against The Sodden Knight
can drag on for quite some time if you use your starting weapon against him. You
can shorten the fight by throwing Birian Firepots at the boss.</p>
<p>Defeat The Sodden Knight to obtain the Fortress Key and The Sodden Knight&apos;s
