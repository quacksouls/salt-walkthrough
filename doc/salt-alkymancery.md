entrance to the Salt Alkymancery.

## The Witch of the Lake

While this boss can be fought melee alone without a shield, the majority of her
attacks are deadly, are arcane damage, and can one-shot you. A safe strategy is
to block the boss' attacks, whether arcane or physical, with the Ashen Effigy
and look for a safe window to attack. The safest window to attack is while she
is performing the Arcane Barrage. If caught in the Arcane Barrage, your
character would most likely die from the attack. However, if your character is
positioned underneath the boss while she is performing the Arcane Barrage, the
arcane attack would miss you, giving you an opportunity to get in one or two
jump attacks. Equip the Faithful Ring to boost your defense against arcane
damage. Buff your weapon with Blessed Page.

Start from the sanctuary of Siam Lake and proceed left until you enter the Salt
Alkymancery. Rest at the sanctuary as soon as possible. The Salt Alkymancery is
a maze-like area. You have to explore the area yourself to get a feel for how to
navigate the area. To get to the area boss, you should unlock a grated gate that
opens a shortcut to the boss.
