# Red Hall of Cages

This area has an optional boss. The main reason for exploring this area is to
find a secret passage that leads to Cran's Pass. Defeating the boss of Cran's
Pass would unlock a shortcut to The Ruined Temple, an endgame area. You should
explore Red Hall of Cages to find various useful consumables and spells. The
Despondent Thief is found in a hidden section of the area. You must advance her
quest line to receive her quest reward.

Many strong enemies at the Red Hall of Cages are weak against holy damage. An
example is the Hanged Man, which hovers above ground level. Stock up on Blessed
Page as necessary; these can be purchased from the Cleric NPC. The Obsidian
Pillar III is recommended for this area. From now on, consider equipping armour
pieces that provide better defense than the Rogue set. At minimum, equip the
Split Mask as your character's head piece. Apart from providing decent defense,
the Split Mask also increases your Endurance by 3 points, thus increasing your
maximum equip load. Farm salt as necessary to level up and invest in skills that
boost your Endurance and allow you to equip armour pieces that provide better
defense. From here on, enemies will hit hard.

Start from the sanctuary of Red Hall of Cages. Head right to find the Masterless
Knight and exhaust his dialogue. Then return to the above sanctuary and continue
left. You will find an obelisk, on either side of which can be found a shiny.
Interact with the obelisk and head right into a room where you will find the Mad
Jester. Exhaust his dialogue and grab all nearby treasures. Exit the room and
continue upward through the area. Once you are done exploring the top of the
area, head down into the lowest depth of the area. Along the way, look for the
Despondent Thief and exhaust her dialogue to further her quest line. You will
also unlock the secret passage to Cran's Pass. Finally, farm for a Red Lord's
Ear as a prerequisite for opening the shop of an NPC in an upcoming area.

Before fighting the area boss, spend some time to farm for a Red Lord's Ear from
the various Red Lords scattered throughout the area. You need one Red Lord's Ear
to open the shop of an upcoming NPC. Equip the Kismet Stone and the Brightcoral
Ring to boost your item find rate. Also, equip the Grasping Ring in case you
need extra salt to level up. You should find Red Lord x 4 scattered throughout
the area, one of which is protected by a Heartseeker.

## The Tree of Men

{% youtube id="fdDK0NNcZcc", title="23. The Tree of Men, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

This is a multi-creature boss. The first phase is you fighting various Chained
Men, each hanging from a different location of the boss. In the second phase,
you will attack the head of the boss. During both phases, the boss itself is
weak against arcane damage. Buff the Obsidian Pillar III with a Stained Page.
The difficulty of the whole fight is navigating your way around the various
platforms that comprise the arena, while avoiding flame vents that periodically
shoot fire. Equip the Impen Crest Ring to boost your fire defense.

Defeat the boss and enter Hager's Cavern to rest at its sanctuary.
