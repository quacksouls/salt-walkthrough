<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXv6mvoSvUw" target="_blank">9. Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXv6mvoSvUw" title="9. Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/eXv6mvoSvUw/0.jpg" alt="9. Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary"></a></p>
<p>Start from the sanctuary of The Watching Woods and head right. Use the Mossy Key
to unlock the door to Sunken Keep. Your objectives in this area are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect the Warhammer. The weapon will be your main weapon for many upcoming
areas of the game. At a later area, you will farm a material to transmute the
Warhammer to the Obsidian Pillar, which you can take to endgame.</li>
<li>Defeat the Kraekan Cyclops to obtain the Green Key. The key unlocks a door
leading to an NPC that grants you the Vertigo Brand. This brand is required
to access the Castle of Storms, where you will farm a material to transmute
the Warhammer. The Vertigo Brand can also be obtained by defeating the other
boss of the area, i.e. The False Jester. You only need to defeat one of two
bosses of the area to be granted the Vertigo Brand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sunken Keep is littered with Retchfeeders, a type of enemies that is invisible
at first and becomes visible if your character stands next to their spawning
points. Do not rush through Sunken Keep because you would most likely run past
the spawning points of multiple Retchfeeders, and the enemies would appear and
chase after you. Every once in a while stop to look for any visible Retchfeeders
that run after you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNYDADWhfZQ" target="_blank">10. Farm salt &amp; gold at Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary</a><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNYDADWhfZQ" title="10. Farm salt &amp; gold at Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/WNYDADWhfZQ/0.jpg" alt="10. Farm salt &amp; gold at Sunken Keep, Salt and Sanctuary"></a></p>
<p>Ensure you at least have the skill Class 3 Heavy Macefighter in order to
two-hand and one-hand the Warhammer. Farm enemies at Sunken Keep as necessary to
collect enough salt to acquire the above skill. Two-handing the Warhammer should
allow you to one-shot most enemies at Sunken Keep. Although not necessary for
now, aim to acquire the skill Class 4 Heavy Macefighter before venturing beyond
Sunken Keep. Use Lock of Hair x 3 and A Soldier&apos;s Poem to upgrade the Warhammer
to Warhammer III. Visit the Nomad merchant at The Festering Banquet to purchase
Locks of Hair as necessary.</p>
<p>While the Warhammer can one-shot most enemies at Sunken Keep, the particular
enemy you should be wary of is the Heartseeker. This enemy tends to float in the
air, can be tricky to fight, and requires multiple hits. The Heartseeker
protects whichever enemies are closest to itself, shrouding them in a white aura
of invincibility. As long as the enemies are protected by the white aura, you
cannot deal damage to the particular enemies. Dispatch of the Heartseeker first,
then deal with the remaining enemies. Alternatively, lure the enemies away from
the Heartseeker, far enough away for the aura of invincibility to disappear so
you can deal damage. Buff your weapon with a Blessed Page or Pitchfire to help
you quickly defeat the Heartseeker.</p>
<p>Notable loots:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Soldier&apos;s Poem. On an elevated platform after entering Sunken Keep. Save
this for upgrading the Warhammer.</li>
<li>Stone Blacksmith. On the same shiny as where you collect A Soldier&apos;s Poem.
Offer this item at the sanctuary of Sunken Keep to spawn the Blacksmith NPC,
but doing so is not necessary because you can use the Guide NPC to teleport
to whichever sanctuary already has the Blacksmith.</li>
<li>Crystalmoat Ring. Reduce by 50% the effect of fatigue on your maximum
Stamina. The longer you fight enemies in an area, the more fatigue you
accumulate and the lower would your maximum Stamina become. Equip the
Crystalmoat Ring to reduce the effect of fatigue on your Stamina. The ring
is located underneath an elevator, to the left of the arena of the Kraekan
Cyclops.</li>
<li>Bell of Return x 6. Three are found near a grated gate that leads to Hager&apos;s
Cavern. You cannot unlock the gate at the moment.</li>
<li>Warhammer. On a ledge below a tower, above which you collect Bell of Return
x 3. You should be able to at least two-hand the weapon by now.</li>
<li>Link of Fire and Sky. At the far right of the sanctuary at Sunken Keep. From
the sanctuary, head right and navigate various platforms, some of which are
breakable.</li>
<li>Blessed Weapon. A Prayer that buffs your weapon with holy damage. If you do
not have the required Prayer skills, the Blessed Page is a viable
alternative.</li>
<li>Stone Mage. Found at the far right of Sunken Keep. From the lowest depth of
Sunken Keep to the right of the boss arena, head right and pass Heartseeker
x 2. Continue into Red Hall of Cages to find a treasure chest guarded by a
Torturer.</li>
<li>Red Shard x 5. From the same treasure chest where you collect the Stone
Mage.</li>
<li>Stone Merchant. On a ledge accessible by interacting with a wall. The wall
is located to the left of the sanctuary at Sunken Keep.</li>
<li>Pack of Salt. From the same shiny where you collect the Stone Merchant.</li>
<li>Crystal Sphere. Hidden by the canopy of various trees. Crush a Crystal
Sphere at a sanctuary of a different creed and the sanctuary would be
converted to your creed.</li>
<li>Plated Band. Equip to increase your Strength and consequently your attack
power. Useful for a Strength build.</li>
<li>Light. A Prayer that illuminates your immediate surrounding. Not as useful
as the Torch if you cannot afford to invest in Prayer skills.</li>
<li>Stone Leader. On a platform underneath the arena of The False Jester.</li>
<li>Green Key. Automatically added to your inventory after defeating the Kraekan
Cyclops.</li>
<li>Kraekan Cyclops&apos; Horn. Automatically added to your inventory after defeating
the Kraekan Cyclops.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is usually the first difficult boss in the game. Two-hand the Warhammer III
and buff it with Pitchfire, Stained Page, or Blessed Page. If you are far enough
away from the boss, you might want to throw a few Birian Firepots to chip down
the boss&apos; HP.</p>

<p>Use the Green Key to unlock the door underneath the arena of The False Jester.
Ascend an inclined path to find a lever, pulling which would open a grated gate
leading to a shrine. Head right, ascend a platform and go left to find the Mad
Jester. Interact with the Mad Jester, answer &quot;Yes&quot; to his question, and you
would be granted the Vertigo Brand. The brand allows you to interact with
various obelisks that has the effect of inverting gravity for your character.
With the help of the Vertigo Brand, you can now access areas that were
previously inaccessible. Use the Vertigo Brand to collect the following notable
loots:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chain set: Chain Coif, Chain Hauberk, Chain Gauntlets, Chain Chausses.
The chest piece, gauntlets, and leggings are recommended for a Strength
build. You can equip these armour pieces and take them to endgame.</li>
<li>Silver Leaf</li>
<li>Stone Alchemist</li>
<li>Stone Merchant</li>
<li>Crystal Sphere</li>
<li>Bronze Key. Unlocks a door right before you enter Castle of Storms.</li>
<li>Sack of Salt and Askarian Scutum</li>
<li>Voracious Charm. Leeches HP from enemies. Might not be as useful as the
Bloodflower Charm for a Strength build. You can always buy Red Shards from
the Merchant and top up your HP bar.</li>
<li>Gray Pearl</li>
<li>Sparkling Ring and Stone Guide. Dropped from the Bronze Knight atop a
platform at The Festering Banquet.</li>
<li>Black Pearl</li>
</ul>

<p>The boss is weak against arcane damage. Buff the Warhammer III with a Stained
Page.</p>
