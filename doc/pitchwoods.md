# Pitchwoods

{% youtube id="cuu10Ww24Sk", title="49. Pitchwoods: cheese Spindlebeast x 3, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

Pitchwoods is an optional area. It is also the final location where you will
meet the Masterless Knight. Defeating the area boss would open the path to your
last encounter with the Masterless Knight and therefore ending the NPC's quest
line. Pitchwoods is also home to the creed Keepers of Fire and Sky. To obtain
all achievements in the game, you must take an oath with this creed. Some tricky
platforming is required to reach the sanctuary of the creed.

Stock up on at least Birian Firepot x 30. You will need this consumable to
defeat the most dangerous enemy found at Pitchwoods, i.e. Spindlebeast. You can
take various paths to reach Pitchwoods. The recommended path is to start from
the sanctuary of Siam Lake, head left, ascend a ladder, and proceed right into
The Ruined Temple. Here you should meet the Masterless Knight. Exhaust his
dialogue to advance his quest line. Continue right into Pitchwoods until you see
the first of Spindlebeast x 3. Use a bow and arrows to lure one Spindlebeast
into The Ruined Temple. Jump on a platform and from there throw Birian Firepots
at the Spindlebeast until it burns to death. Rinse and repeat the strategy for
each of the remaining Spindlebeasts.

Some tricky platforming is required to reach the shrine of the area. Ensure you
defeat the Spindlebeast x 3 first, then remove all your equipped armour pieces
and weapons so your equip load is 0. Being at 0 equip load would allow you the
fastest movement speed and the furthest jump distance. Perform some tricky
platforming to reach the top of a tower. Descend the tower from the right to
reach the ground on the right side of the tower. Now enter the tower from the
right side and pull a lever to unlock a shortcut.

Notable loots:

-   Templar's Charm. Boosts your attacks with holy damage. Found high above the
    ground, on a platform hidden by the canopy of various trees. You must ascend
    a number of appearing/disappearing platforms to reach the treasure.
-   Gray Pearl. Found after pulling a lever to unlock a shortcut. The treasure
    is next to a cliff where you drop down to access a secret creed.
-   Case of Salt. Atop a tower. Can only be reached by some tricky platforming.
    You need to overcome this tower to unlock a shortcut to the area boss.
-   A Lord's Orders x 3. Within the first group of Impaled Knights.
-   Box of Salt. On a platform. Can only be collected after defeating the area
    boss.
-   Drowned Censer x 4. On the beach near the arena of the area boss. Can only
    be collected after defeating the boss.

## Carsejaw the Cruel

This optional boss should be relatively easy to defeat with the Obsidian Pillar
VII. Equip the Impen's Charm to add extra fire damage to your attacks. Buff your
weapon with Stained Page.

Defeat the boss, then head right to meet the Masterless Knight. Exhaust his
dialogue and be gifted A King's Orders. You have now completed the Masterless
Knight's quest line.
