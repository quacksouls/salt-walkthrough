# Bandit's Pass

Bandit's Pass is on the path to the Castle of Storms, where you will receive the
Shadowflip Brand. The brand is required to access various mandatory areas in the
game.

Start from the sanctuary of Shivering Shore and head right into Bandits' Pass
and rest at its sanctuary. Do not join the creed of this sanctuary yet. Push
ahead right deep into Bandits' Pass. Enemies in this area tend to cluster
together. Whenever possible, lure one or two enemies away from a group to make
the fight manageable. On the other hand, the Warhammer III can easily one-shot
all enemies in the area.

Pass the various groups of enemies you should find a ladder. A little further
ahead is an obelisk. Interact with the obelisk to invert gravity so your
character can traverse the chasm and enter the Castle of Storms. Avoid fighting
enemies, but instead find and rest at the sanctuary as soon as possible. On your
way to the sanctuary, you would encounter the Masterless Knight. Interact with
him to advance his quest line.

    Bronze Key to unlock the door.

    Bandits' Pass. Located underneath the Masterless Knight who sits
    despondently on a platform. Equip the ring to slowly regenerate your HP.

    consumables.
