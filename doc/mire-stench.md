# Mire of Stench

{% youtube id="k11p8YJaKO0", title="27. Mire of Stench, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

The theme of this area is poison. You will meet a merchant named Alde Griggs who
sells a variety of poison-related consumables, the most useful of which is
Antidote. Antidote can also be purchased from the Merchant NPC. The area has a
poison swamp and most enemies can inflict the poison status effect. Stock up on
Antidote as soon as possible. You will collect the Vile Vines Ring in the area,
equipping which would boost your defense against poison. However, you still need
to consume an Antidote if your poison status bar is full.

The area contains a dwelling that houses Saltless x 6. These enemies drop
Drowned Locket, an upgrade material for upgrading the Obsidian Pillar. You
require Drowned Locket x 3 to upgrade the Obsidian Pillar II to Obsidian Pillar
IV. Although not necessary at the moment, consider farming the Saltless at the
Mire of Stench to upgrade the Obsidian Pillar as high as possible prior to
fighting the area boss.

Notable loots:

-   Satchel of Salt
-   Vile Vines Ring. Boosts your defense against poison. On a platform to the
    far right of the sanctuary of the area.

    shrine, head right and drop down into Hager's Cavern.
-   Venomous Blade. Buffs your weapon with poison. Located near a lever that
    unlocks a shortcut to Hager's Cavern. To the right of where you grab the
    Gray Pearl.

This boss is weak against fire. Buff the Obsidian Pillar III with (Imperial)
Pitchfire and equip the Impen's Charm. Equip the Vile Vines Ring to boost your
poison defense because the boss and its summoned minions can inflict the poison
status effect.
