# Ziggurat of Dust

Your objective in this area is to open the passage to obtaining the Dart Brand.
First, you must defeat The Dried King, one of two bosses in the area. Outside of
the Ziggurat, you will find an item that allows you to complete Fern's quest
line. Defeating The Bloodless Prince, the other boss of the area, would allow
you to meet the Scarecrow and advance its quest line. The upper part of the
Ziggurat of Dust contains the Ashen Effigy, one of the best great shields in the
game. Collect this shield if you prefer a board and sword type of combat.

## Upper

{% youtube id="msgVI-jsgWE", title="35. Upper Ziggurat of Dust, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

Start from the sanctuary of the Ziggurat of Dust. You will explore the upper
half of the area. Proceed left to find a Bound Arrox. If it runs away from you,
then leave it alone. Otherwise dispatch of the enemy. Light your Torch to
activate the Hardlight Brand, jump and bounce off the vertical platforms to
reach the top. Head left to find another Bound Arrox, above which is a lever.
You cannot directly reach the lever, but must ascend various platforms then drop
down to find the lever. Pulling the lever would extend a vertical platform that
allows you to jump onto and bounce off in order to reach the top, where you
would find an obelisk. To the left of the obelisk is a grated gate. Interact
with the obelisk and navigate your way down and right, then head up and left and
drop down to find the lever behind the gate. Pull the lever to open the shortcut
to The Dried King.

From the sanctuary of the area, continue left and you should be outside of the
Ziggurat, standing on a platform. Ascend the structure and then down to find the
Bag of Earth. This item is required to complete Fern's quest line. Return to the
Village of Smiles, locate Fern, and give him the Bag of Earth to receive a
reward. The reward given depends on how you answer his questions.

Notable loots:

-   Ashen Effigy. One of the best great shields in the game. Can block 100% of
    arcane and holy damage, and has high physical and elemental defense. While
    blocking with the shield, any physical attack would be reflected to the
    attacker, who would take a percentage of the physical damage. Found near the
    left-most entrance to upper Ziggurat of Dust. Start from the sanctuary of
    the area and proceed left until you see a shiny.
-   Charred Doll x 3
-   Flame Barrage. A Spell that summons a stream of fire. Dropped by a Mimku
    underneath the arena of The Dried King.
-   Stone Charm. Boosts your stagger damage. Can only be reached by interacting
    with an obelisk.
-   Stone Guide. Can only be reached by interacting with an obelisk.
-   Bag of Earth. Found above and outside of the Ziggurat of Dust. Give to Fern
    in exchange for a reward.

## The Dried King

This boss primarily deals fire damage. Equip the Impen Crest Ring to boost your
fire defense. Buff the Obsidian Pillar VII with a Blessed Page.

Defeat the boss, head left and up a passageway to find the Black Sands Sorcerer.
Exhaust his dialogue and answer "Yes" to his question to be gifted the Dart
Brand. Exhaust his dialogue again and answer "Yes" to his question to advance
his quest line.

You should now be able to equip the Chain Hauberk while remaining below 70%
equip load. Upgrade the Chain Hauberk as high as you can. If necessary, farm
enemies in the area for salt and invest in skills that increase your Endurance
and hence your maximum equip load.

## Lower

You will now explore the lower half of the Ziggurat of Dust. Start from the
sanctuary of the area, head left to find a Bound Arrox who stands on a platform.
Drop down the platform and you should see a red wall to your left. Light your
Torch to activate the Redshift Brand to allow you passage through the red wall.
Enemies in the area are weak against fire. Equip the Impen's Charm to deal fire
damage and/or buff your weapon with (Imperial) Pitchfire.

The lower half of the Ziggurat of Dust can be tricky to navigate. You must
interact with an obelisk and proceed in a roundabout manner to open various
levers that unlock a number of gates. One of the gates opens a passage to the
area boss. Proceed to the depth of the area to find a lever guarded by Drowned
Porcelain x 3. Pull the lever to activate the nearby elevator. Ride the elevator
up to find a passageway leading to the sanctuary of The Far Beach.

Notable loots:

    Drowned Porcelain.

    circle back to a platform underneath the treasure.
