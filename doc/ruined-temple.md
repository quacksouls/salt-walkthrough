Start from the shrine of the Ziggurat of Dust. Head left to find Scarecrow and
answer "Yes" to his question to further his quest line. The best item found in
the area is the Bloodflower Ring. Equipping the ring would boost your attack
power. Explore the area for various high-end upgrade materials, including
Diamond Cluster, A Lord's Orders, Twisted Heart, and A King's Orders. Collect
upgrade materials and upgrade your armour pieces as high as possible in
preparation for the area boss.

## The Coveted

{% youtube id="PilsE3LEE-o", title="40. The Coveted, Salt and Sanctuary" %}{% endyoutube %}

The giant axe is the boss, not the two apparitions hovering above ground. Attack
the giant axe whenever possible. The best window for attacking is when the axe
is planted into the ground. However, when an apparition wields the axe, a jump
attack can also hit the axe. The boss is weak against arcane damage. Buff your
weapon with a Stained Page.
