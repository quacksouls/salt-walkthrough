<p>This is a beginner&apos;s guide to your first playthrough of Salt and Sanctuary. We
will focus on melee, in particular a Strength build. Here are some tips to keep
in mind as you explore the game.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose Knight as your starting class. You will be given a sword and shield.
The sword will be used for a couple of early game areas, after which you will
swap to the Warhammer. As for the &quot;Effects&quot;, choose the Amber Idol. The item
will be used later on to transmute the Warhammer to a weapon that you will
take to endgame.</li>
<li><p>Magic is over-powered. Feel free to experiment with a magic playthrough,
instead of a melee playthrough. You might find the following mage playthrough
useful:</p>
<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVnpjDgCga1-hXDi6hjC_A7S0QlPaNCC" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVnpjDgCga1-hXDi6hjC_A7S0QlPaNCC</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to defeat the very first boss, The Unspeakable Deep. The boss is
optional, but defeating it would reward you with the Drowned Tome, in
addition to a huge amount of salt and other items. Having the Drowned Tome
early would allow you to max out your main weapon early.</p>
</li>
<li>Be mindful of your equip load and movement speed. Less than 25% equip load
gives you the fastest movement speed and rolling animation. Between 25% and
50% equip load, you would have normal movement speed and roll animation. From
50% to 75% equip load, you would have medium movement speed and roll
animation. Being over 75% equip load would result in you being encumbered.
Your character would have the slowest movement speed and roll animation. At
100% equip load or more, your character would not be able to roll at all and
you would move at snail pace. Generally, you should aim to be less than 70%
equip load. Various jumps and platforming are difficult to make unless your
equip load is as low as possible.</li>
<li>Various items called Stone Blacksmith, Stone Merchant, Stone Guide, etc. are
scattered throughout the game. Offer each of these items at a sanctuary to
spawn the corresponding NPC. The Stone Blacksmith spawns the Blacksmith NPC,
the Stone Merchant spawns the Merchant NPC, the Stone Guide spawns the Guide
NPC, and so on. Strictly speaking, you need only one of each of these stone
NPCs because you can use the services of the Guide NPC to travel to the
sanctuary where you spawned the appropriate NPC. For example, you might want
to spawn the following NPCs at the sanctuary of Shivering Shore: Merchant,
Guide, Cleric, Mage. Each of these NPCs sells useful consumables, some of
which are effective against many enemies and bosses. The Guide NPC is the
most useful because he allows you to travel to any sanctuary where you have
rested. He also sells the Calling Horn, a consumable that allows you to
teleport to any sanctuary where you have spawned a Guide NPC. The Bell of
Return, a consumable sold by the Merchant NPC, allows you to return to any
sanctuary or shrine at which you last rested. If you are to repeatedly spawn
an NPC at multiple sanctuaries, you should spawn the Guide NPC. As another
example, you might want to spawn the Alchemist NPC, the Guide NPC, and the
Leader NPC at the sanctuary of The Village of Smiles. The Blacksmith NPC is
already located at the sanctuary of The Village of Smiles, hence no need to
offer the Stone Blacksmith there. The Blacksmith NPC can upgrade your weapons
and armour pieces, while the Alchemist NPC can transmute your weapon to a
higher class, thus dealing more damage output. Offer various items to the
Leader NPC to deepen your creed devotion and receive a reward of your
choosing. Anytime you need the services of an NPC, use a Calling Horn to
teleport to the sanctuary of Shivering Shore or the sanctuary of The Village
of Smiles.</li>
<li>The most useful armour set is the Lamprey set. Each piece of the set can
reflect a percentage of physical damage back to the attacker. The auxiliary
effect also works even if you block a physical attack with a 100% physical
block shield. The Lamprey set is found on a platform at Sunken Keep. You must
defeat one of the bosses of the area to obtain a key that unlocks the passage
leading to the armour set. You also require two brands to allow you to
navigate to the set. To properly use the Lamprey armour set, you must invest
Black Pearls in the skill Class 4 Heavy Armor.</li>
<li>The most useful shield is the Ashen Effigy, found near an entrance to the
Ziggurat of Dust. The shield can block 100% of arcane and holy damage. The
shield also has high defense against physical and other elemental damage. To
effectively use the Ashen Effigy, you must invest Black Pearls in the skill
Class 4 Shield.</li>
<li>Farm enemies for salt to help you level up and invest in skills you care
about. Enemies also drop gold. Spend gold in the shop of the Merchant NPC to
buy various collections of salt, e.g. Bag of Salt, Case of Salt, etc.</li>
